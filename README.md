👋 HI, I'M SANTHOSHI BIRADAR

I’m finished my Master’s in Information Systems at Saint Louis University (May 2025).

I’m a Business Intelligence Analyst with hands-on experience in data analysis, dashboard creation, and delivering insights that help teams make informed decisions. I enjoy collaborating with stakeholders across departments to turn raw data into KPIs and visualizations that clearly show trends, patterns, and opportunities.

I graduated with a Master’s in Information Systems from Saint Louis University and have worked on projects using Power BI, SQL, DAX, Excel, and Python (pandas). My focus is on delivering practical solutions that improve processes and produce measurable results.

Some highlights of my work:

✅ Amazon – IT Analyst Intern – Improved reporting efficiency by analyzing 5,000+ records with SQL and Excel, enhanced project alignment by collaborating across teams, and reduced process downtime by 20% through workflow optimization.
✅ Accenture – Process Associate (Quality Analyst) – Developed performance dashboards that increased reporting efficiency by 30%, conducted 100+ weekly audits, and standardized workflows across multiple teams.
✅ Customer Churn Analysis – Built a Power BI dashboard to analyze churn patterns, calculated KPIs with DAX, and identified early churn drivers to improve retention strategies.
✅ Employability Analytics Dashboard – Designed a dashboard analyzing 500+ student records, increasing stakeholder engagement by 25% and reporting efficiency by 40%.

Leadership & Volunteer Experience:

Project Lead – Student Engagement Video: Led a team to create an educational video, managing scripts, recording, and editing, delivering the project on time.

Alumni Meet Coordinator: Organized events, managed logistics, and boosted alumni participation.

Outside of work, I enjoy basketball 🏀, hiking ⛰️, trying new recipes 🍳, and traveling ✈️ to explore different cultures. I like finding the story in data and making it actionable.

I’m always happy to connect with fellow professionals, share insights, and explore opportunities—feel free to reach out!
