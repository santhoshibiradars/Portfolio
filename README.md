👋 HI, I'M SANTHOSHI BIRADAR

I’m finished my Master’s in Information Systems at Saint Louis University (May 2025).

I’m a Business Intelligence Analyst with hands-on experience in data analysis, dashboard creation, and delivering insights that help teams make better decisions. I work with stakeholders to turn raw data into KPIs and visualizations that clearly show trends and opportunities.

I graduated with a Master’s in Information Systems from Saint Louis University and have completed projects using Power BI, SQL, DAX, Excel, and Python (pandas). My focus is on delivering practical solutions that improve processes and help teams make informed decisions.

Some of my projects include:

✅ Customer Churn Analysis – Analyzed churn trends and identified patterns that helped improve retention strategies.
✅ Sales Performance Dashboard – Created dashboards showing top products and customer behavior to guide business planning.
✅ Employability Analytics Dashboard – Designed dashboards to help academic teams identify skill gaps and track student placement trends.

Outside of work, I enjoy basketball 🏀, hiking ⛰️, trying new recipes 🍳, and traveling ✈️ to experience new cultures. I like finding the story in data and making it actionable.

I’m always happy to connect with fellow professionals, explore opportunities, and share insights—feel free to reach out!

If you want, I can also rework this into a concise LinkedIn summary version under 150 words that still keeps the connect-friendly tone. Do you want me to do that?
